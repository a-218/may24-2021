# W03D03 - HTTP Cookies & User Authentication

### To Do
- [x] HTTP and cookies
- [x] Render pages differently based on language preference
- [x] Register user with email and password

### HTTP Problem
* stateless protocol
* it has no reason to remember each transaction from one to the next

### Cookie
* small text file stored in the browser (key/value)
* set on the response from the server
* every cookie (for that domain) gets sent to the server with EVERY request
* domain-specific
* set an expiry date TTL, expire on the session
