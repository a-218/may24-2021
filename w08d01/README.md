# W08D01 - Unit & Integration Testing

### To Do
- [x] Tools for testing React
- [x] Coverage Reports
- [x] Add Features/Tests to our App
- [x] `debug()` and `prettyDOM()`
- [x] Mocking AJAX Requests and Functions

### Jest
* test runner
* an error being thrown (assertion library)
* same syntax as Mocha

### Common Problem
* how to test the DOM?
* testing-library
* React Testing Library
* Interact with the DOM, fire events, render React components
